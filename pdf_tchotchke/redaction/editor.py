This module creates classes for a convenient representation of 
the structure of a pdf document and has some methods to add or 
remove (mainly remove) objects.

Notice that to a pdf, a page is just an object referencing others.

---- PDF BASICS ---- 
# From the PDF 1.7 reference
In a compressed or uncompressed pdf, you may notice this:
The highest level constructions in pdf files are indirect
objects and xref tables. Indirect objects contain direct 
objects (with relevant information about how to draw the
page) and a label to that indirect object. Xref tables
collect the information about the labels of each object
and their locations in the file to reference the contents 
of the document. A label to an object looks like 'N M obj'
where N is the number of the object and M is a number 
(typically 0) representing which version of the file that 
object was added in (0 is for original).

You may notice the following in an uncompressed pdf:
Within indirect objects are direct objects which can be
- Boolean Values
- Integer and real numbers
- Strings (literal characters or hexadecimal)
- Names
- Arrays
- Dictionaries
- Streams
- The null object
For example, each page in a page object is represented by
a dictionary. A general property of objects is that they 
are allowed to make references to other objects (these 
look like 'N M R') to include data from other indirect 
objects. For example, each page has a dictionary with an
array of references to other indirect objects, whose
contents are what is actually drawn on the canvas.

If we want to delete an object from a pdf, it is enough to
make that object and all references to it disappears, and 
then to update all other labels and references by renumbering 
them and the xref table.

This process closely follows the example in Section G.6 of the 
PDF 1.7 reference, except that it actually deletes objects from the pdfs
instead of just their object references. That is, there is no revision history.

#Searching in PDF Basics
PDF reading applications read the file from back to front!
They first read the trailer dictionary, which contains a reference to 
document catalog (/Type/Catalog or /Root in trailer). This contains a reference
to the Page Tree object (/Type/Pages) which in turn references the individual 
page objects, which in turn reference the content streams that land on the page
Figure 3.5 of the pdf 1.7 reference shows this structure quite nicely.

At the level of the page object is where visible elements of the pdf may be
removed. For instance, there may be /Contents objects or /Annots objects or
/Watermark objects referenced as /XObjects in the Page /Resources dictionary 
which can be deleted.
