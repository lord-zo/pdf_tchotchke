This script redacts pdfs via removing objects one at a time.
I see that all the other python pdf parsing libraries are 
using the object-oriented approach and I dislike it for my
intended purpose, which is simply to remove objects from the
pdf canvas. The approach in this script is to execute code
to modify the pdf file directly by 1, deleting an object, 2 
deleting all references to that (indirect) object, 3 update 
all other object numbers and corresponding reference, and 4
reconstruct the xref table for the new pdf. An attempt will
also be made to remove watermarks with the tools herein.

---- PDF BASICS ---- 
# From the PDF 1.7 reference
In a compressed or uncompressed pdf, you may notice this:
The highest level constructions in pdf files are indirect
objects and xref tables. Indirect objects contain direct 
objects (with relevant information about how to draw the
page) and a label to that indirect object. Xref tables
collect the information about the labels of each object
and their locations in the file to reference the contents 
of the document. A label to an object looks like 'N M obj'
where N is the number of the object and M is a number 
(typically 0) representing which version of the file that 
object was added in (0 is for original).

You may notice the following in an uncompressed pdf:
Within indirect objects are direct objects which can be
- Boolean Values
- Integer and real numbers
- Strings (literal characters or hexadecimal)
- Names
- Arrays
- Dictionaries
- Streams
- The null object
For example, each page in a page object is represented by
a dictionary. A general property of objects is that they 
are allowed to make references to other objects (these 
look like 'N M R') to include data from other indirect 
objects. For example, each page has a dictionary with an
array of references to other indirect objects, whose
contents are what is actually drawn on the canvas.

If we want to delete an object from a pdf, it is enough to
make that object and all references to it disappears, and 
then to update all other labels and references by renumbering 
them and the xref table.
