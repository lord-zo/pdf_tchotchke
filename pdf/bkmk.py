# A script to generate pdf bookmarks in cpdf syntax
# Written by Lorenzo Van MuÃ±oz
# Last updated Dec 17 2020

# This script imports a txt file whose lines come in text and page number pairs.
# It then places these pairs into an array.
# A numbering adjustment is then made to the page numbers.
# The index level of each bookmark entry is inferred using some simple rules.
# Then the array is written to a txt file with the correct bookmark syntax.
# Cpdf  and Ghostscript/pdfmark syntaxes are supported.

# Start with defintions

        # print data to that format and a sense statement which is a
        # regular expression to detect whether a line has that format
        # The data to print corresponds to (x,y,z) = (index,title,page)

def getIndex(entry):

    Determine the index of an entry (this is simplistic and the logic should be refined depending on the content)
    
    Arguments:
        String : ideally a line from a table of contents

    Returns:
        Integer : 0 if the line starts without an integer or an integer without trailing decimal
                  1 if the line starts with a decimal like X.X where X are integers
                  2 if the line starts with a double decimal like X.X.X
                  3 the pattern goes on
