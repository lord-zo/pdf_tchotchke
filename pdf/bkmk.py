# A script to generate pdf bookmarks in cpdf syntax
# Written by Lorenzo Van MuÃ±oz
# Last updated Dec 14 2020

# This script imports a txt file whose lines come in text and page number pairs.
# It then places these pairs into an array.
# A numbering adjustment is then made to the page numbers.
# The index level of each bookmark entry is inferred using some simple rules.
# Then the array is written to a txt file with the correct syntax for cpdf bookmarks.

import os,sys,filenames,re

# Start script
print("bkmk.py - a script to make pdf bookmarks\n")

# Change working directory to directory where script was called from
# whereas the script is run from sys.path[0]
os.chdir(os.getcwd())

filepath,outpath = filenames.fileio(ext=".txt")

# import file
with open(filepath,"r") as file:
    # read in file as a contiguous string
    data = file.read()

# Get each line in file (excluding empty line and newline characters)
lines = data.rstrip().split("\n")

def getIndex(entry):
    '''
    Determine the index of an entry (this is simplistic and the logic should be refined depending on the content)
    
    Arguments:
        String : ideally a line from a table of contents

    Returns:
        Integer : 0 if the line starts without an integer or an integer without trailing decimal
                  1 if the line starts with a decimal like X.X where X are integers
                  2 if the line starts with a double decimal like X.X.X
                  3 the pattern goes on
